# AI-Driven Dynamic Pricing for Sustainable Product Markets

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a dynamic pricing strategy for sustainable products in the market. The goal is to predict optimal prices using machine learning models, considering factors like demand elasticity, competitor prices, inventory levels, and eco-friendly certifications.

## Data Description

The dataset contains information about various products and includes the following columns:
- **Product_ID**: A unique identifier for each product.
- **Product_Name**: The name or description of the product.
- **Category**: The product category (e.g., Personal Care, Stationery, Household).
- **Base_Price**: The original price of the product before adjustments.
- **Demand_Elasticity**: A measure of how sensitive the product's demand is to price changes.
- **Seasonal_Factor**: A factor indicating the effect of seasonal trends on demand.
- **Competitor_Price**: The price of similar products from competitors.
- **Inventory_Level**: The available stock of the product.
- **Customer_Rating**: The average rating given by customers.
- **Green_Certification**: A binary indicator showing if the product is eco-friendly (1 = Certified, 0 = Non-Certified).
- **Profit_Margin**: The percentage of profit earned on the product.
- **Inventory_Risk**: The calculated risk associated with the productâ€™s inventory levels.
- **Adjusted_Elasticity**: A refined version of demand elasticity considering market factors.
- **Competitor_Price_Difference**: The difference between the product price and competitor prices.
- **Green_Certification_Label**: A label indicating the type of certification (Certified or Non-Certified).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The first phase of the project involved **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset, identify patterns, and check for any inconsistencies or anomalies. Key steps included:
- **Analyzing the distribution** of key variables such as `Base_Price`, `Demand_Elasticity`, and `Inventory_Level`.
- **Performing correlation analysis** to explore relationships between variables like `Competitor_Price` and `Profit_Margin`.
- **Handling missing values** and outliers.
- **Visualizing data** using **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for better insights.

For a detailed breakdown of the **EDA** process, including the code, visualizations, and specific steps taken, please refer to the `eda.ipynb` file located in the project directory.

## Feature Engineering

During the feature engineering phase, several transformations were applied to improve the model's performance:
- **Creating new features** such as `Adjusted_Elasticity` and `Competitor_Price_Difference` to better capture market dynamics.
- **Encoding categorical variables** like `Category` and `Green_Certification` using **one-hot encoding**, **label encoding**, and leveraging **CatBoost** for native handling.
- **Scaling continuous variables** such as `Base_Price` and `Inventory_Level` using **Min-Max scaling**.

The detailed feature engineering steps and code for these transformations are available in the `eda.ipynb` file. Please refer to it for a comprehensive view of the process.

## Machine Learning Models

This project utilizes several machine learning models for demand prediction and price optimization:
- **CatBoostRegressor**: A gradient boosting algorithm designed for categorical features.
- **AdaBoostRegressor**: A boosting algorithm that combines weak models to create a strong model.
- **GradientBoostingRegressor**: A machine learning technique for regression tasks using an ensemble of decision trees.
- **RandomForestRegressor**: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions.
- **LinearRegression**: A linear approach to modeling the relationship between the target variable and one or more features.
- **KNeighborsRegressor**: A regression technique that predicts the target based on the closest training examples in the feature space.
- **DecisionTreeRegressor**: A decision tree algorithm for regression tasks.
- **XGBRegressor**: A gradient boosting method, optimized for speed and performance in regression tasks.

## Variables

In this project, the **dependent variable** (target) and **independent variables** (features) have been defined as follows:

#### Dependent Variable
- **Base_Price**: The target variable that we are trying to predict. It represents the original price of the product before any dynamic pricing adjustments.

#### Independent Variables
The following features are used as independent variables to predict the **Base_Price**:
- **Competitor_Price**: The price of a similar or equivalent product offered by competitors in the market.
- **Profit_Margin**: The profit percentage earned on the product relative to its cost.
- **Inventory_Level**: The current stock available for the product, measured in quantity.
- **Inventory_Risk**: A calculated measure of the risk associated with holding inventory for the product, influenced by stock levels and demand trends.
- **Adjusted_Elasticity**: A refined version of demand elasticity, adjusted for additional market or behavioral factors.
- **Category**: The product category to which the product belongs (e.g., Personal Care, Stationery, Household).
- **Green_Certification_Label**: The eco-friendly certification label for the product (e.g., "Certified", "Non-Certified").
- **Product_Name**: The name or title of the product.

These independent variables are used in conjunction to build and train the machine learning models for predicting the **Base_Price**.
