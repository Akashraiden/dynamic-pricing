#### Checking of Null values , if null was found in dataset then we can use some techniques

##### Identifying Missing Values:

         '''[Checked for missing values using tools like isnull() or info(). Handling Strategy:]

            Dropping Missing Values: Removed rows or columns where a significant portion of data was missing and couldn't be imputed.
            Imputation:

            Used mean/median for numerical columns.
            Used mode for categorical columns.
            Applied advanced techniques like interpolation or predictive imputation where necessary.'''
